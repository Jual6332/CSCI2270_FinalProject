# CSCI2270_FinalProject

Summary:
This project will compare the effectiveness of several non-cryptographic 
hashing algorithms through examining their uniqueness and speed. For each
algorithm, a set of data will be input and the algorithm's number of 
collisions and average time spent hashing will be recorded. Each algorithms
efficacy can be compared using these parameters. The class will contain
the methods to compare the functions, and algorithms can be put into
different methods and compared in the overall wrapper.
